# ThanxChallenge

Instructions:
 - Open ThanxChallenge.xcworkspace and run project
 
Notes:
 This is an iOS challenge for Thanx. Since there are not many hashtags for #thanxinc in the last week, there will not be many tweets 
 displayed. However, as for @ThanxInc, there are many tweets to be displayed, so I have paginated the result by 25.
 I have also used AutoLayout to proportionately fit every screen depending on iPhone size.
 

Pods:

'STTwitter':

'SVProgressHUD':
